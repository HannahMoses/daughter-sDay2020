                   <h2>Color confusion </h2>




             <p>      Kids can say things that teach the truth in a toffee.
                 Even bitter truths are like toffee melting in my mouth, When
                 my kid says it with innocent, earnest honesty !! <br>
                <strong> TRUTH !</strong> Truth could be so elusive, until a kid,
                says it with <em> brutal honesty. </em>
                   I remember the day, my kid solved a big, divisive, destructive
                   issue that has been a plague to humans - in a sweet sentence !
                   We were having a cozy mother-daughter quality time. My daughter
                   Amgela was 2 years old and sitting in my lap, as we were looking
                   at my birthday photos from last week. My friends had a surprise birthday party
                   for me with purple roses, cake, kid-friendly food and we had taken
                   a bunch of photos to record all the fun stuff we had done that day.
                   My daughter looked at a photo where she and her friend were sitting
                   on a couch looking darling !! They were best buddies !
                   Suddenly my daughter ,Angela exclaimed, "Look mommy !! Rachel's
                   Vanilla and Iam chocolate ! " It took me a second to understand that,
                   Angela had realized that her friend and she had different skin colors.
                   RAchel was White and my daughter was Black. But my daughter had not yet
                   heard about race . So she just referred to Rachel's WHite skin as
                   'Vanilla' and her own Black skin color as 'chocolate !'.
                        What an unnecessary load of trouble we have heaped up over the
                    years, by teaching kids to recognize skin color as a racial
                    difference ! So I decided not to tell her she was Black and not
                    CHocolate. She was as sweet as chocolate ;so what's the harm if I
                    let her call herself chocolate ??!! YUMMY !!!

                Iam from India ,where being born with darker skin is an inferior thing.
                Indians use face cremes to lighten their skin -' Fair & Lovely ' was a
                famous brand that promised to lighten skin color in just a few weeks !
                  Lighter the skin color of a girl, lower the dowry her parents need to
                  give her husband's parents !! So a little investment in skin lightening
                  cremes is thought of as a good investment for one's daughter- even in 2020 !

                  So, when we took my daughter,Angela, to India, my maid told her that she
                  needs to lighten her skin and started rubbing tumeric paste mixed with
                  some natural powders on Angela's skin. I was pregnant at that time and was
                   having morning sickness that day.So the maid had cajoled Angela to let her
                   lighten Angela's skin. But my daughter's skin broke out into a rash.

                                    Oh,boy ! what a mess !
                  My little daughter was crying and I felt such regret that she had
                  found about, the  " Black and White " skin differences in such a rude way.
                  Gone was the sweet reference to her skin color as 'chocolate' !!
                  She is still my chocolate - my sweetie !!

                    <h2>Cool Chair</h2>
             <p>    My second daughter,Alice, is always curious about her surroundings
                  <em><strong>She's always asking me questions !!</strong></em>
                  So I enrolled her in a pre school, so that her teacher and I could
                  take turns answering Alice's ever -growing set of questions . Oh,boy !
                  her brain must have tons of little wheels that churn out questions
                  incessantly !! IT was funny,though ,that I missed her little curious
                  voice asking me questions that morning , while,ALice enjoyed her first
                  day at pre school. She had been pleading me for weeks, by then, to let her
                  go to school, as she was a "BIG GIRL" now !! Sure enough, the little tike
                  had an enchanting day at her pre school. Now it was my turn to see the world
                  through ALice's eyes. For once, instead of asking questions, Alice was
                  enlightening me about all the new things she had seen and learnt at her
                  pre school. Finally, when Alice paused, to take a breath, I jumped in
                  with my questions and asked ALice, about the best thing she liked at her
                  pre school. Alice's eyes started shinig with wonder as she exclaimed,"The
                  best thing at school is my teacher's COOL CHAIR ! " I was amazed, as I
                  realized that,ALice was referring to her paralyzed teacher's wheel chair !!

                      I guess it takes a child's innocence to put things into perspective !
                  I had known that her teacher was paralyzed a few years ago and felt sorry
                  for her. And here was my dear little daughter-referring to  such a misfortune
                  as a cool thing !! I was looking at, 'what her teacher had lost' ,while Alice
                  was looking at 'what her teacher had gained' - a brand new COOL CHAIR !!

                  I quickly changed the subject , afraid that, Alice might ask me, to buy her a
                  cool chair for Christmas. With kids, you never know what to expect !!!
